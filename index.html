                <h3>My inspiration</h3>
                <p>My inspiration is my Dad. When I was studying in class 6 , dad told me if I can get a good result he will buy a computer for me so that I can Play games. 
                    I tried so hard and got the desire result I wanted , and then dad kept his promise and bought me a computer . I was so curious about the new device that I even opened it . From then that computer was my best friend and I got inspiration to be a Computer Science Engineer. So you can it was my dad , if he didn't say that he will buy me a computer then I wouldn't be here.
                    and after I grew Up I've inspired from Zahid Sabur Vaia. </p>
